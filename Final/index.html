<h5>Data Background</h5>
<p>This dataset was from National Vital Statistics System and focused on heart disease mortality data in US during 2014. The data was collected in county level. Here were the basic information of this dataset:</p>
<ul>
<li>2013 to 2015, 3-year average. Rates are age-standardized. County rates are spatially smoothed. The data can be viewed by gender and race/ethnicity. Data source: National Vital Statistics System. Additional data, maps, and methodology can be viewed on the Interactive Atlas of Heart Disease and Stroke <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/maps/atlas" class="uri">http://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/maps/atlas</a></li>

<h5>Main question: How gender and races associate with heart disease death rate in CA during 2014?</h5>
<p>Sub-question</p>
<ul>
<li>what was the association between gender and heart disease death rate in California?</li>
<li>what was the association between race and heart disease death rate in California?</li>
<li>Which county had relatively higher heart disease death rate within gender stratification?</li>
<li>which county had relatively higher heart disease death rate within race stratification?</li>

<p>The histogram of death rate for both male and female was constructed, and insufficient data was represented by 0. From the graph, distributions of heart disease death rate for both male and female were slightly skewed to the left. However, the distribution of female located more left compared to the distribution of male, and only a small portion overlapped. It indicated that the female had a lower heart disease death rate compared to the male in general in CA during 2014.</p>

<p>The histogram of death rate for different race/ethnicity was constructed, and insufficient data was represented by 0. From the graph, both Hispanic and Asian and Pacific Islander seemed to be skewed to the left and had one modal. The White, Black and American Indian and Alaska Native seemed to have two modals. Among all races in CA during 2014, the Black had the highest heart disease death rate. The White and American Indian and Alaska Native were next and had similar distribution of death rate. The White seemed to have a slightly more right distribution. The Asian and Pacific Islander had a fourth highest heart disease death rate. The Hispanic had the lowest heart disease death rate.</p>

<p>Within gender stratification and female category, Kern County, Tulare County and Glenn County had relatively higher heart disease death rate during 2014. For male category, Tulare County and Tuolumne County had relatvely higher heart disease death rate during 2014. Without any stratification, kern County and Tulare County had relatively higher heart disease death rate during 2014. The counties along the coast generally had a lower death rate than the counties not along the coast. The possible reason might be the different medical levels in each county. Compare the general trend, male had a higher death rate than female in general, which also indicated by histogram before. The possible reason might be the different lifestyle.</p>

<p>Within race stratification, for the white, Stanislaus County had relatively higher heart disease death rate during 2014. The death rate fell in the middle range. For the Hispanic, Kern county had relatively higher heart disease death rate during 2014. The death rate fell in a lower range. For the Black, Lassen County, Kings County and Tulare County had relatively higher heart disease death rate during 2014. The death rate fell in the higher range. For Asian and Pacific Islander, Mariposa County had relatively higher heart disease death rate during 2014. The death rate fell in the lower middle range. For American Indian and Alaska Native, Shasta County had relatively higher heart disease death rate during 2014. The death rate fall in the middle range.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There were association between both gender and race stratification and heart disease death rate in California during 2014. For gender stratification, female had a lower death rate than male in general. The female in Kern County, Tulare County and Glenn County had relatively higher heart disease death rate. The male in Tulare County and Tuolumne County had relatvely higher heart disease death rate. From a overall view, Kern County and Tulare County had relatively higher heart disease death rate. The possible reason might be that different county had different medical services level. The overall trend show that counties along the coast had lower death rate, which might due to higher developmental level. For race/ethnicity level, the Black had the highest death rate. especially in Lassen County, Kings County and Tulare County. The White and American Indian and Alaska Native had middle level of death rate, but slightly higher in Stanislaus County and Shasta County correspondingly. The Asian and Pacific Islander had a lower middle death range, and slghtly higher in Mariposa County. The Hispanic had the lowest death rate, and slightly higher in Kern county. The possible reasons may be different in distribution of races, education level, income level, healthcare availability and access to medical services.</p>
