# PM566 Midterm Project

## Introduction

#### (provide background on your dataset and formulated question)

##### Data Background

2013 to 2015, 3-year average. Rates are age-standardized. County rates
are spatially smoothed. The data can be viewed by gender and
race/ethnicity. Data source: National Vital Statistics System.
Additional data, maps, and methodology can be viewed on the Interactive
Atlas of Heart Disease and Stroke <http://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/maps/atlas>
What is the association between Heart diseases death and two
stratification (gender and races) in California?

## Methods

#### (include how and where the data were acquired, how you cleaned and wrangled the data, what tools you used for data exploration)

``` r
library(gsubfn)
```

    ## Loading required package: proto

    ## Could not load tcltk.  Will use slower R code instead.

``` r
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
```

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'dplyr'

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:data.table':
    ## 
    ##     between, first, last

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
    ## 
    ##     filter, lag

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
    ## 
    ##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union

``` r
library(dtplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(leaflet)
library(sf)
```

    ## Linking to GEOS 3.8.1, GDAL 3.2.1, PROJ 7.2.1

``` r
library(raster)
```

    ## Loading required package: sp

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'raster'

    ## The following object is masked from 'package:tidyr':
    ## 
    ##     extract

    ## The following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':
    ## 
    ##     select

    ## The following object is masked from 'package:data.table':
    ## 
    ##     shift

``` r
# download and read in the data
if (!file.exists("Heart_Disease_Mortality_Data_Among_US_Adults__35___by_State_Territory_and_County.csv")) {
download.file("https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/i2vk-mgdh/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD", 
              method="libcurl", 
              timeout = 60
              )
}
heartdisease <- data.table::fread("Heart_Disease_Mortality_Data_Among_US_Adults__35___by_State_Territory_and_County.csv")
```

``` r
# check for NAs
knitr::kable(dim(heartdisease))

## Preliminary Results

#### (provide summary statistics in tabular form and publication-quality figures, take a look at the kable function from knitr to write nice tables in Rmarkdown)

``` r
CA_gender %>%
    ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Data_Value)) + 
    geom_histogram(mapping = aes (fill = Stratification1)) +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "BuPu") +
    labs(
      x = "death rate per 100,000 population",
      y = "Count",
      title = "Histogram of death rate by gender in CA")
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
